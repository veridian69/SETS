## Watch it evolve

Every 4.8 seconds a new generation is born. Immigrants and offspring appear in the gene pool, get backtested, face the out-of-sample gate, and everything that is not an elite dies. The best config that survives the gate takes over the paper grid.

| Evolve | Select | Trade |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Crossover and mutation over 8 genes. Species quotas stop one lucky family from wiping out the rest. | Train on 70% of the tape, then gate on the unseen 30%. Only configs that stay profitable with low drawdown survive. | The leader runs a real grid-DCA bot on the out-of-sample candles: fills, take-profit, stop, fees. |

## Explore your way

- **Run / Pause**, **Step** to the next generation, and **1× 2× 4× 8×** speed.
- **Click any node** in the gene pool to inspect its genome, train and out-of-sample results. Click empty space or press **Esc** to return to the leader.
- Change the **seed** to grow a completely different evolution. Same seed, same result, every time.
- Keyboard: **Space** pause, **→** step, **1–4** speed.
- URL options: `?seed=42`, `?speed=4`, `?warm=50` (evolve 50 generations instantly on load), `?paused`.
- Works on phones: panels stack, nothing scrolls sideways.

## Run locally

Requires Python 3 (to serve the files) and any modern browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/sets-machine.git
cd sets-machine
python -m http.server 8000 --directory dist
```

Open **http://localhost:8000**. That is all: no npm install, no build step, no keys, no database. Everything runs client-side in plain ES modules.

**Host it for free on GitHub Pages:** Settings → Pages → *Deploy from a branch* → `main` / `(root)`. The root `index.html` forwards visitors to `dist/`.

**Run the tests** (Node 18+, no dependencies):

```bash
node --test tests/*.test.mjs
```

**Refresh the market data** from Binance's public API (standard library only, no key):

```bash
python tools/fetch_data.py --hours 2400
```

## How it works

### The genome

Each strategy is a long-only grid-DCA bot described by 8 genes:

| Gene | Range | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `family` | 4 species | Entry logic: **Momentum** (z-score above +Z), **Mean revert** (below −Z), **Vol breakout** (close above the previous N-bar high), **Range grid** (inside a quiet band) |
| `lookback` | 10–200 h | Window for the rolling mean, deviation and breakout high |
| `entryZ` | 0.2–2.5σ | How far price must stretch before the bot enters |
| `levels` | 2–8 | Number of buy orders in the grid |
| `spacing` | 0.3–3% | Distance between grid levels |
| `mult` | 1–2× | Size multiplier per deeper level |
| `tp` | 0.3–4% | Take-profit above the average entry |
| `stop` | 1–12% | Stop below the deepest level; closes everything |

### The loop

| Stage | In the code |
| --- | --- |
| **Observe** | Read volatility of the current tape window |
| **Hypothesize** | Inject 8 random immigrants |
| **Mutate** | Tournament selection inside each species, uniform crossover, Gaussian mutation (p = 0.18) |
| **Backtest** | Every newcomer is backtested on train (70%) and out-of-sample (30%) |
| **Select** | Keep the top 4 overall plus the best of each species; everyone else dies |
| **Deploy** | Best train fitness among configs that pass the gate becomes the paper-trading leader |

**Fitness:** `train return − 0.6 × max drawdown`, with a penalty below 4 trades.
**Gate:** out-of-sample return > 1%, drawdown < 10%, at least 3 trades, win rate ≥ 50%.

### No peeking

- Signals are computed on the **close of bar j** and executed at the **open of bar j + 1**. A test proves that changing a future candle cannot change a past signal.
- Inside a bar, fills are processed **adverse-first**: grid fills, then stop, then take-profit.
- Every fill and exit pays a **0.04%** fee. Open positions are marked out at the end of a test window.
- The paper-trading panel replays the out-of-sample candles with the **same `GridBot` class** that the backtests use, so what you see is what was scored.

## Honest results

A sample of runs after 50 generations on the bundled data (train 2026-06-23 → 08-23, out-of-sample 08-23 → 09-22):

| Seed | Leader species | Train return / DD | Out-of-sample return / DD | OOS trades | Buy & hold (same 30 days) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026 | Range grid | +28.8% / 4.5% | **+8.4% / 5.3%** | 5 | +11.4% / 7.7% |
| 7 | Vol breakout | +28.6% / 4.3% | **+8.3% / 7.7%** | 4 | +11.4% / 7.7% |
| 42 | Mean revert | +30.8% / 2.9% | **+7.3% / 3.9%** | 54 | +11.4% / 7.7% |

Read this before getting excited:

- On this window **buy & hold made more money**. The evolved grids made less, with a smaller drawdown in two of three runs.
- The out-of-sample window is 30 days with a handful of trades. That is a sanity check, not proof of an edge.
- Picking the leader from configs that passed the gate reuses the out-of-sample data, so its numbers are optimistic.
- High win rates come from wide stops that were never hit in this window. That is exactly the risk a grid carries.

### Walk-forward over a full year

`tools/walkforward.mjs` is the only evaluation here that means anything. Each fold evolves on 1 800 hours (train 70%, gate 30%) and then trades the leader on the next 600 hours that evolution never saw. It also scores random genomes that merely pass the same gate, with no evolution at all. On a year of BTCUSDT (2025-09-23 → 2026-09-23, 54% peak-to-trough drawdown), 11 folds, 5 seeds each:

| Fee per fill | Evolved leader | Buy & hold | Random genomes that pass the gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.04% (this app's default) | +32% compounded, t ≈ 1.5 | −12% | not run |
| 0.10% (retail Binance) | −6.5% | −12.4% | −4.0% |

- The apparent edge at 0.04% is a fee assumption, not an edge. One constant flips the sign.
- Random search that passes the gate does as well as 50 generations of evolution. The gate does what little work there is.
- The simulator is optimistic: fills at the limit on a touch, stops fill at the stop level through gaps, no slippage, whole equity in one grid.

Reproduce it (the long tape is not committed, so the app is unaffected):

```bash
python tools/fetch_data.py --hours 8760 --out data/btc-1y.js
node tools/walkforward.mjs --data data/btc-1y.js               # 0.1% fee
node tools/walkforward.mjs --data data/btc-1y.js --fee 0.0004  # the app's fee
```

SETS MACHINE is a transparent research toy for watching evolutionary search work. It is **not** a trading bot to connect to real money.
